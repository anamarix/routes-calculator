This is a simple route calculator for searching fastest routes between 2-3 places. It assumes that we travel by car. 
We can chceck the instructions on how to arrive at the destinations if we want.
The program also chceck the weather for us, both at the starting point and at the destination point at the time of arrival.
It calculates the total km and the day and hour of arrival.
I am using HERE Maps for that project.
